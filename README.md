##💡Inspiration💡

While trasure hunters is searching for treasures, they pass through the rigorous steps of going into tunnel and bringing the treasures, this sometimes is dangerous to their health, the inspiration for this project came from this, what if we have robots which can explore and search for treasures even where a human cannot reach

##❓What it does❓
The robot searches for treasure and notify the controller via a sounding buzzer and also send SMS notification using Twillio

##🏗️How we built it🏗️
We trained the model using Google cloud TensorFlow Lite and then deploy the model on a raspberry pi 

##🚧Challenges we ran into🚧
Working with google cloud and Auth0 for authenticating the robot controller

##🏅🏆ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆
We are proud of the final project we built. We learned a lot while working on the project not just technically but also time management. We are proud we could complete the project and deliver a beautiful fully functional Hack this weekend.

##⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️Time Management⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things altogether. We lost alot of hackathon time in brainstorming and team building yet we are proud that things went according to our plans. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing our work and focusing on multitasking. Extremely excited for all the learnings and teachings we had got through this hack.
